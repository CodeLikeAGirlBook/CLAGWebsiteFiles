        <h3>Q. Where can I buy the book?</h3>
        <p> A. Yes! It's available at independent bookstores in your area, and online at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Like-Girl-Projects-Practical/dp/1524713899"  target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/code-like-a-girl-rad-tech-projects-and-practical-tips-by-miriam-peskowitz-hardcover/-/A-77096390" target="blank">Target</a>.

        <h3>Q. Help!! I'm reading the book and there's something I don't get. </h3>
        <p> A. Coding gets complicated. I've got your back. I'll keep track of any issues that come up here,  <a href="https://github.com/CodeLikeAGirlBook/Issues" target="_blank">on Code Like a Girl's Github page</a>, so head on over. If that doesn't work, <a href="https://twitter.com/MiriamPeskowitz" target="_blank">send me a tweet</a>.

        <h3>Q. Where do I find a Raspberry Pi (for chapter 2) and those LED-wire-sensor thingies, I mean supplies? </h3>
        <p> A. Yeah, chapter 2 puts together a computer from a Raspberry Pi and chapter 5, creating code that makes sensors work and LEDs light up. You can just read along, but  <a href="https://github.com/CodeLikeAGirlBook/Electronics-Kit">click here for ideas on how to find these parts</a>.

      <div class="box" id="about-Miriam"><h3>Q. Miriam, why did Miriam write this book?</h3>
        <p> A. I didn't start off as a coder, only as someone who was fascinated by code -- and angry that the tech industry has become so male-dominated. That's why I decided to immerse in learning to code, and explain it to everyone else.
